Cloudmesh client is a simple client to enable access to multiple cloud
environments form a command shell and commandline. It is grown out of
the need to simplify access to multiple clouds for researchers and
students easily. In contrast to our earlier versions of cloudmesh it
explicitly separates the code to only target client code. Due to this
simplification it is also possible to install the client code not only
on Linux, OSX, but also Windows. We have tested the installation on
Windows 10.

development, please contact Gregor von Laszewski at
