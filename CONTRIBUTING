The project is open source and if you like you can help. 

Here are some contribution guidelines:

* we use the Apache 2.0 licence

* use pycharm for editing

* use ``Code Inspect`` regularly on the files you modify and fix the sensible pep8 warnings.
  Look at other warnings and errors

* use ``.format`` instead of ``%`` in print

* use ``from __future__ import print_function`` at the beginning of the file and use
  ``print("msg")`` instead of ``print msg``

* use as much python 3 like code developed in python 2

* use ``class name(object):`` and not just ``class name:``

* use ``Console.error`` when printing errors if you develop a command for the commandline

* use ``ConfigDict`` when reading yaml files

* use nose tests for testing your programs

  An example is provided in ``tests/test_sample.py``::

    nosetests -v --nocapture tests/test_sample.py

  you can copy this to ``tests/test_yourfile.py`` and then replace in
  that file the occurrence of ``_sample`` with ``_yourfile``

  make sure to create meaningful tests.

* the documentation is write in RST http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html

* look at http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html for tips to make
  python 2 look more like python 3.
  Be careful with dicts to make them not inefficient.

* we are using https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitchangelog for creating changelogs automatically.
  Thus you need to use a prefix in any commit. It includes the type and the user for which the commit is relevant.
  Examples are::

     chg: usr:    simple changes relevant for users (spelling, ...)
     fix: usr:    major changes for users
     new: usr:    new feature for users

     chg: dev:    simple changes relevant for developers (spelling, ...)
     fix: dev:    major changes for developers
     new: dev:    new feature for developers
